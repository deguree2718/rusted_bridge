# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

There's only one version currently under development, so... I guess all versions are supported?

| Version | Supported          |

| all   | :white_check_mark: |


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, open an issue, and/or send me a message on discord (deguree2.718)

The message should be formatted as follow:

# [Name your error]
description of your error

- Operation System used
- version of rusted_bridge used
- any important software and/or hardware info related (such as rustc version, if there's any printers connected, if this was used on a rust application or using the WebAssembly version)

If any are available, send screenshots of the error returned (if any), or evidence of the vulnerability
